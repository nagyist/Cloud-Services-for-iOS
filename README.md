SESClient Library is a logging and analytics library works with Smartface Enterprise Server (SES).

## Usage


- Unzip sesclient-ios.zip, drag all files and drop on your project in Xcode. Check "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)"
- In your Project and Target settings, add "-all_load" parameter to "Other Linker Flags"
- Navigate to Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries add CoreLocation.framework, SystemConfiguration.framework, CoreTelephony.framework and AdSupport.framework.
- Import necessary headers

```objc
#import "SESClient.h"
```

##### Starting Session
User activities are recorded in a session. A session shuld be started for tracking.
At the first start, user will be prompted to enable location services for your application.
```objc
[[SESClient sharedSESClient] startSession:@"YOUR_API_KEY" url:@"SES_URL"];
```

##### Ending Session 
Session can be ended to stop tracking.
```objc
[[SESClient sharedSESClient] endSession];
```

##### Pausing Session
startSession method will be called to resume a paused session.
```objc
[[SESClient sharedSESClient] pauseSession];
```

##### Recording Customer
Customer can be recorded with customer information. With customParams parameter, information about customer can be sent in JSON format.
```objc
[[SESClient sharedSESClient] recordCustomer:@"name" :@"surname" :@"phone_number" :@"email" :@"customer_id" :@"{\"key\":\"value\"}"];
```

##### Recording Event
Events can be recorded by defining an event direction for creating detailed path analyze.
```objc
[[SESClient sharedSESClient] recordEvent:@"event_direction" :@"{\"key\":\"value\"}"];
```

##### Checking Update
In your application, an update check mechanism can be used with SES.
At first checkUpdateDelegate will be set.
```objc
@interface ViewController () <checkUpdateDelegate>
```
getLastResponse method will be overriden.
```objc
-(void) getLastResponse:(NSMutableDictionary *) responseParams{
    NSLog(@"%@",responseParams);
}
```
checkUpdate method wil be called.
```objc
[[SESClient sharedSESClient] checkUpdate];
```

##### Logging
To see SESClient logs on XCode log window, logs should be enabled. Enabling logs before starting session is suggested.
```objc
if (![[SESClient sharedSESClient] getLoggingEnabled]){
    [[SESClient sharedSESClient] setLoggingEnabled:YES];
}

```
